<h3>About Me</h3>
<br>
<b>
<p>I was born and raised in Southern California where I grew up in a Lakers towns 
and always had good music playing around the home.These threads of family,basketball and music 
have defined my lide path and experiences. I am entering my final year at the University of Pennysylavia
where I am studying CyberSecurity at the Warton School of Technology.
Additionally, I am a team captain on Penn's Women's Basketball Team</p>
<p>Talking about my parents, my father Charlie Brooks, is an accountant amnd my mother Stacy Brooks ,
 is a baker. I have two siblings; John is doing Masters in Computer Science and David is doing Masters in Finance and Management.
 I literally didn't have any idea of how I choose my career. First of all , I hadn't any idea of texhnology.My grandfather is the one who 
 kept on introducing me to new technologies.Daily evening he used to tell me about new technologies  introduced which he read morning.I was really interested in knowing more and more 
 about Artificial Intelligence and Cyber Security. After completing my course on CyberSecurity I wish to do a course in Artificial Intelligence.</p>
 <p>Looking back, I am really proud of what I am today! My grandfather is the one who stood as a strong pillar of my support</p></b>
